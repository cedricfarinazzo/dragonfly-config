"""
Command-module loader for CMU Pocket Sphinx.

This script is based on 'dfly-loader-wsr.py' written by Christo Butcher and
has been adapted to work with the Sphinx engine instead.

This script can be used to look for Dragonfly command-modules for use with
the CMU Pocket Sphinx engine. It scans the directory it's in and loads any
``_*.py`` it finds.
